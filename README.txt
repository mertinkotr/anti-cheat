I have been asked to develop a software for Counter-Strike tournament to prevent cheat-ing online. This program was randomly taking users’ screenshots and sending them to FTP server where they were analyzed against cheating. For a user-side I used C# .Net framework. The FTP server and users database were integrated in existing website ofthe tournament.
